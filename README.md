## Bugs

- Fixed issue with header where the form was overlapping the header.
    - Initialy fixed it by using z-index, but as it was bad practice I found a way around it and removed the z-index.
- Discovered that there was a bug with smaller screens where the Home button on the nav bar would go under the under the Sign Up button.
    - Reduced the letter-spacing to 1px.
- Issue with scroll bar on horizontal
    - fixed it is by reducing px on the images width from 375px to 360px
- The footer on the home page was showing in front of Algarve info
    - fixed it by putting the Algarve info inside of DIVs

## Problems

- I did have a problem with website running on Chrome, it was accused of being unsafe([Screenshot](assets/images/readme-images/bug/deceptivesite.png)), I tried it on different browsers such as Firefox, Safari, Microsoft Edge and they all worked fine with no issues.
- I couldn't find any issues with any part of the code so I contacted google regarding the issue and requested them to verify the website by following this [steps](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9008080?hl=en#cms&zippy=%2Csites-that-use-a-website-hosting-platform-wordpress-shopify-wix-etc). After being verified, it was considered safe again([Screenshot](assets/images/readme-images/bug/googlesafe.webp)).
