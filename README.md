## Testing

- I have tested that this website works on diferent types of browsers like Chrome, Safari and Firefox.
- The project is responsive as I have tested it on diferent types of screen sizes using devtools.
- All content of every page is readable and easy to understand.
- All locations presented on the website work, once you click them it will open a new tab.
- The form in the Sign Up page works as it should, email field only accepts emails and submit button works.

## Bugs

- Fixed issue with header where the form was overlapping the header.
    - Initialy fixed it by using z-index, but as it was bad practice I found a way around it and removed the z-index.
- Discovered that there was a bug with smaller screens where the Home button on the nav bar would go under the under the Sign Up button.
    - Reduced the letter-spacing to 1px.
